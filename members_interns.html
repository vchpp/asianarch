						In 2013, I graduated from UC Davis with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior (NPB). Growing up in San Francisco as a first generation Chinese American and serving as a patient advocate/interpreter at the Paul Hom Asian Clinic (UC Davis) helped shape my passion in advocating for & addressing health disparities among Asian American communities. Currently, I am a first year medical student at UCSF. I am also a student with PRIME-US, a program tailored to medical students who are interested in working with underserved communities in urban settings. Being a part of APAMSA and the Asian Health Caucus at UCSF have helped me stay connected with others who are also interested in AAPI advocacy. Through working with ARCH, I hope to gain a better understanding of health disparities facing Asian Americans. Moreover, I am really interested in how I can use research to highlight and address some of these issues as a future health provider.
