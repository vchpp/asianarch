					<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco.  My research focuses on social and cultural determinants of mental health, particularly the contextualization of psychological outcomes within the sociocultural milieu of racism, acculturative stress, and classism.  I have conducted quantitative and qualitative studies of racially and ethnically diverse populations, including Asian Americans.  I have examined mental health issues of body image concerns, disordered eating (e.g., clinical or subclinical binge eating, restricted eating), depression, and substance use.  Building upon these experiences, I am also interested in physical health topics, particularly obesity, healthy eating, weight management, and type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevention.  I am especially interested in exploring behavioral interventions (e.g., culturally relevant positive psychology constructs) that may reduce risks for such clinical problems.
