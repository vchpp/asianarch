					<p>I am a Postdoctoral Scholar with a joint appointment in the Departments of Medicine at UC San Francisco &amp; UC Davis.

My research interests largely revolve around using community-engaged methods to understand and address health disparities among understudied Asian &amp; Pacific Islander subgroups, with a particular focus on contextual and culturally-framed risk factors.  My current studies are focused on understanding the myriad factors influencing unique forms of tobacco use among South Asians in the United States, and their contribution to tobacco-related disease in this population (including disproportionate burdens of cancer).  This information will be ultimately valuable for comprehensive and targeted intervention strategies.  I serve as a committee member on the California Health Interview Survey (representing South Asians), am a member of the Asian American Cancer Awareness, Research &amp; Training's (AANCART) Training Core, nd am a member of the Data &amp; Research Subcommittee for Asian American Partners for Empowerment, Advocacy &amp; Leadership (APPEAL).
