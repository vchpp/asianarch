			<td><p>I am an Assistant Professor and health services researcher in the Department of Family Health
Care Nursing at UCSF. My program of research focuses on (1) examining the impacts of family
on individual health outcomes among those with chronic conditions, and (2) exploring how
ethnic/cultural variations in family processes may impact on designing and delivering health
care services. I am currently conducting a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of
FACE program (Family-Centered Care program for older adults with multiple chronic conditions,
K01NR015101). The long-rage goal of this study is to help older adults with depression and
chronic conditions and their family caregivers better manage their health together. I am a
member of the National and Local Patient and Stake Holder Council for the Stride study, a large
PCORI/NIA funded pragmatic trial of fall prevention for older adults in the community. I recently
was appointed as member of the American Nurses Association Minority Fellowship Program
National Advisory Committee. I was an Okura Mental Health Leadership Foundation fellow. <br />

        <td><p>Dr. Van Ta Park is an Associate Professor at UCSF, School of Nursing, Department of Community Health Systems, and teaches in the Advanced Public Health Nursing (APHN) program. Her primary research interest is to address issues related to racial and ethnic minority health and healthcare disparities, especially among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). Her research areas include mental health, substance use, and intimate partner violence. Her current projects examine the barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health and related treatment, and the effectiveness of innovative and culturally appropriate programs to address mental health stigma and barriers to help-seeking. She was awarded the Alzheimerâ€™s Associationâ€™s Mentored New Investigator Research Grant to Promote Diversity (MNIRGD). The purpose of this three year grant (2015-18) is to culturally tailor a program to reduce stress and depression among Vietnamese American dementia caregivers. Dr. Ta Park is also a recipient of a pilot grant (2017-18) from Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford Precision Health for Ethnic and Racial Equity (SPHERE) and SPECTRUM to develop and evaluate a Korean drama precision mental health curriculum among AAPI who speak English, Vietnamese Americans who speak Vietnamese, and Korean Americans who speak Korean. She also has several other studies investigating the role of Korean drama to destigmatize mental health and help-seeking.
